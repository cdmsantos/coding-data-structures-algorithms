/***
 * 
 * Shortest Distance from All Buildings
 * 
 * 
 * You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:
 * 
 * each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely, each 1 marks a
 * building that you cannot pass through, and each 2 marks an obstacle that you
 * cannot pass through. You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches
 * all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. You can only move up,
 * down, left, and right.
 * 
 * Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible
 * to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.
 * 
 * The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of
 * the friends and the meeting point.
 * 
 * The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) =
 * |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]] Output: 7 Explanation:
 * Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2). The
 * point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel
 * distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,0]] Output: 1 Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1]] Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 50 grid[i][j] is either 0,
 * 1, or 2. There will be at least one building in the grid.
